		<h1>Understanding The Difference of Left Hand vs. Right Hand Using GoFitts</h1>

		<h3>Summary:</h3>

		I tested the ability of my roommate and I's left hand vs. right hand using the GoFitts Program.  I ran the test "Fitt's Task 1D or 2D" <br> 
		where we had to click between two objects as fast and as accurately as possible.  The grand means of all the data held true to my <br> 
		hypothesis that the right hand would be significantly more accurate and quick that the left.  Unfortunatley none of my roommates <br>
		were left handed so I didn't get any data from a case like that.  For the testing we used the trackpad of a 13" Macbook Pro and ran 9 <br>
		tests with 9 clicks per configuration on both hands.<br>
