			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>Tested 3-key vs 5-key Interaction</p>
			<ul bold>
				
				<li>

				<b>3 - key version</b><br>
				A key = left/previous<br>
				D key = right/next<br>
				S key = click selected button<br>
				<br><br>
				<b>5 - key version (currently implemented)</b><br>
				W key = up<br>
				A key = left<br>
				S key = down<br>
				D key = right<br>
				Q key = click selected button (didn't know if this would be the best select key)<br>
				<br><br>

				</li>


				<li>

					Did the set operations below 5 times each and calculated the average time of each of them would take. <br>
					It was interesting because with more keys I felt like I could move faster but then made a lot of errors. <br>
					With the 3 keys I moved slower and more precise because it didn't feel as familiar I believe.  Another thing <br>
					I noticed was by transitioning from 3 key to 5 key I made some errors in the 1st test of the 5 key because <br>
					I got used to the 3 key.  I also had a thought that maybe if I made the 5 key work so that I did movement with <br>
					the left hand and selection with the right hand maybe it would have felt more natural.  I think it was good however <br>
					to get the consistency of using one hand for both tests.  Overall the results were much different than I <br>
					thought they would be.

					<br><br>
					<b>3 key test results and operations</b><br>
					5*5+3-2 --- (20 seconds, 1 error)<br>
					1+2+3+4+5 --- (16 seconds, 0.5 errors)<br>
					2*8 --- (8 seconds, 0 errors)<br>
					5+3-2 --- (13 seconds, 0.8 errors)<br>
					10/20/5 --- (19 seconds, 0.6 errors)<br>
					<br><br>
					<b>5 key test results and operations</b><br>
					5*5+3-2 --- (14 seconds, 2.2 errors)<br>
					1+2+3+4+5 --- (15 seconds, 2 errors)<br>
					2*8 --- (4 seconds, 0.2 errors)<br>
					5+3-2 --- (9 seconds, 1 error)<br>
					10/20/5 --- (13 seconds, 1.6 errors)<br>
